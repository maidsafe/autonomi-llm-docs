# Understand Autonomi

I want to understand what Autonomi is, how it works, and whether it's a good fit for what I'm trying to build.

Help me explore the concepts, architecture, and mental models I need to understand this network. I'm not looking for implementation details yet - I want to grasp the fundamentals first.

Below is a comprehensive conceptual guide. Use it to help me understand:
- What makes Autonomi different from traditional infrastructure
- The fundamental primitives and how they work
- How to think about Autonomi's decentralized, encrypted storage
- Common architectural patterns and approaches
- Whether Autonomi is right for my use case

Be conversational and exploratory. Help me think through my specific needs and questions.
