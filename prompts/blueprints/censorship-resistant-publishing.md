I want to build publishing platforms on Autonomi where content cannot be taken down by any single authority - permanent, immutable, and globally accessible.

## The Use Case

Publishing platforms where:
- Content persists permanently once published
- No single authority can remove or censor content
- Immutable record of what was published and when
- Globally accessible from anywhere
- Can't be taken offline by server shutdowns or legal action

Examples: Blogs, wikis, documentation sites, journalism platforms, whistleblowing platforms, historical archives, media libraries.

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional hosting or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for publishing content
- How readers discover and access published content (addresses, indexes, domain names)
- How to handle updates to published content (versions, pointers, history)
- How site navigation and structure work without traditional servers
- The implications of permanent, immutable publishing (responsibility, mistakes, moderation)

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
