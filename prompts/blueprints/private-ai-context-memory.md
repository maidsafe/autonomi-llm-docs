I want to use Autonomi for AI context storage - keeping my AI's memory, training data, and conversation history private, permanent, and truly mine across any device or AI service.

## The Use Case

Store AI-related data on Autonomi:
- Conversation histories and context windows
- Personal knowledge bases and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) data
- Training examples and fine-tuning datasets
- Custom instructions and system prompts
- Markdown notes, documents, research
- Embeddings and vector data

All encrypted, globally accessible, and owned by me - not locked into any AI service's infrastructure.

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional cloud storage or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for storing and retrieving AI context
- How to organize documents and data for RAG systems
- How to maintain conversation history across devices and AI services
- How to ensure privacy for sensitive AI interactions
- Whether I can use the same context across different AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
