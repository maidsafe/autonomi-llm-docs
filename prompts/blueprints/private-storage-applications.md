I want to build user-controlled storage applications on Autonomi - alternatives to Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud where users truly own their data and encryption keys.

## The Use Case

Storage applications where users control everything:
- Users control their encryption keys (not the service provider)
- No company can access user files
- Data persists permanently with one-time payment
- Users can access from multiple devices
- Files can be selectively shared with others

Examples: Personal vaults, encrypted backups, secure file sharing, password managers, private photo libraries.

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional cloud storage or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for this use case
- How users manage their keys across devices (generation, storage, recovery, portability)
- Where Data Maps go and how users organize files
- How users share files or collaborate on shared folders
- How to make key management accessible to non-technical users

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
