I want to use Autonomi for blockchain application data - keeping transaction hashes and critical metadata on-chain while storing large datasets, images, and documents off-chain on Autonomi.

## The Use Case

Build blockchain applications where:
- Smart contracts and critical metadata live on-chain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- Large data (images, documents, datasets) lives on Autonomi
- On-chain records reference Autonomi addresses
- Data is immutable, permanent, and content-addressed
- Avoid blockchain storage costs and size limitations

Examples: NFT projects, DAOs with document storage, dApps with user content, on-chain registries with supporting documentation, supply chain verification.

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional hosting or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for hybrid blockchain-Autonomi systems
- How to coordinate payments and operations across blockchain and Autonomi
- How to verify off-chain Autonomi data from on-chain logic
- How to handle updates in systems where both blockchain and Autonomi are immutable
- Cost comparison: blockchain storage vs Autonomi storage
- How to maintain decentralization across both layers

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
