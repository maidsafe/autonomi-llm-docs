I want to use Autonomi to store the actual NFT assets - not just pointers to assets hosted elsewhere, but the images, videos, and media themselves, immutably and permanently.

## The Use Case

Store NFT assets on Autonomi so that:
- The actual media (images, videos, audio, 3D models) lives on immutable, permanent storage
- NFT owners control both the blockchain record AND the underlying content
- Content can't disappear if a company shuts down or stops hosting
- Content is content-addressed and verifiable
- One payment for permanent storage, no recurring hosting fees

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional hosting or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for NFT assets
- How to integrate Autonomi addresses with blockchain NFT metadata
- How NFT owners and viewers retrieve and display assets
- How to handle dynamic NFTs or metadata updates
- Whether existing NFT marketplaces can work with Autonomi-hosted assets
- Cost implications for storing high-resolution media or large collections

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
