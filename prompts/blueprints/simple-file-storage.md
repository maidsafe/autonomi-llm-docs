I want to build a simple file storage application on Autonomi - users upload files, files persist permanently with one payment, and downloads are always free.

## The Use Case

A straightforward file storage application:
- Users upload files (pay once)
- Files persist permanently 
- Downloads are always free
- No subscriptions or ongoing hosting costs

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional cloud storage or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for this use case
- How file upload and download actually work (self-encryption, chunks, Data Maps)
- Where I keep track of user files and how users organize and find them
- How users access files from multiple devices
- How file sharing would work

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
