I want to use Autonomi for tamper-proof, permanent record keeping - any scenario where data must be preserved exactly as it was, with verifiable history and no possibility of alteration.

## The Use Case

Store records that must be:
- Permanently preserved (decades or longer)
- Tamper-proof and verifiable
- Immutable with complete version history
- Globally accessible for verification
- Independent of any single organization's survival

Examples: Research data, legal documents, compliance records, audit trails, historical archives, medical records, academic publications, government records, journalistic evidence.

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional archival or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for archival and records management
- How to prove when something was archived and verify it hasn't been tampered with
- How to maintain version history and provenance
- How to organize and discover records in large archives
- How to handle access control for public vs restricted archives
- Compliance implications (regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
