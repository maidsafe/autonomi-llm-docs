I want to use Autonomi as the storage backend for my existing web application - getting the benefits of decentralized, permanent storage while keeping my traditional web architecture.

## The Use Case

Replace centralized storage (S3, GCS, Azure Storage) with Autonomi:
- My backend manages storage operations
- Users interact through familiar web interfaces
- Data lives on Autonomi instead of traditional cloud providers
- I control keys and orchestrate network interactions

## Help Me Understand

- Why Autonomi would be good for this versus traditional cloud storage or other decentralized alternatives
- How the overall architecture would work for this integration pattern
- How I manage keys and handle payments for user storage
- Where browsers fit in (can they access Autonomi directly, or do I need proxies?)
- How this compares to my current storage costs and performance
- Migration strategy from existing cloud storage

Ask me questions about my specific needs and help me explore how I would use Autonomi for this use case.
