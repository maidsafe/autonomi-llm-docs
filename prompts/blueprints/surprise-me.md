I want you to help me discover something unexpected - an application or use case that's only possible with Autonomi's unique combination of permanent storage, self-encryption, content addressing, and decentralized architecture.

## The Use Case

Help me explore novel applications that leverage Autonomi's unique properties:
- Pay once, store forever (enables economics impossible with recurring fees)
- Content addressing (data self-verifies, enables novel discovery patterns)
- Self-encryption (privacy by default, no trust required)
- No accounts (cryptographic ownership, no central authority)
- Immutability + mutability (permanent content with mutable references)
- Unlimited derived keys (hierarchical access control from one master key)
- True digital permanence (data persists independent of any organization)

## Help Me Understand

- What unique applications or patterns are possible with Autonomi that couldn't exist on traditional infrastructure
- Creative combinations of Autonomi primitives I might not have considered
- Emergent possibilities from pay-once permanent storage
- Novel use cases in areas I'm interested in

Ask me questions about:
- What industries or problems I'm interested in
- What frustrates me about current digital infrastructure
- What applications I wish existed but seem impossible
- What data I wish was preserved but isn't
- What privacy problems I care about solving

Then help me explore how Autonomi's primitives could enable solutions I haven't imagined yet. Be creative. Be ambitious. Help me see what's possible.
