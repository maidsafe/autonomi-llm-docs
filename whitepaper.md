**Autonomi is a data and communications network that, through its underlying protocols, is able to provide users with a distributed, decentralized, and encrypted layer of the internet, you can think of it like a 'Layer 0'. In essence it is a decentralized, autonomous network, running on everyday devices, offering self-encryption, quantum-safe security and lifetime storage. Autonomi is able to combine the spare capacity of connected devices, anything from old consumer PCs on desks and small devices like Raspberry Pis to leftover racks in a data centre - to create a new form of globally accessible infrastructure, that can be utilized by anyone.**

Autonomi allows users to securely store data, communicate, access knowledge, build businesses, run services, and create new futures without the intervention of any middlemen or gatekeepers.

The Network aims to give people autonomy over their digital lives, allowing them to participate in the connected economy, regardless of their location, status, or access to capital. It has been designed to enable mass collaboration between human beings, between machines, and between human beings and machines - critically, without the distorting effects of endemic data insecurity, siloing of knowledge, inefficient markets, and limited accessibility.

In order to do this, and accomplish it in a way suitable for human 'scaled' use, Autonomi has been built from the first principle of secure and private data, and in such a way that the performance of The Network scales with size. Not only is data de-duplicated and redundantly replicated, but it's quantum-proof encrypted, before it even leaves an end user's computer. That means that no personal information ever touches the internet, and neither does any information relating to how, where, or when you choose to access it.

# High-level 'How it Works'

When you use The Network to store some data it is split into 'chunks'. Each chunk is securely encrypted with a set of credentials that are only known by the creator—who has the keys to unlock the data and reassemble it into information again.

These credentials never touch the internet.

Data 'chunks' are then sent to The Network, duplicated several times for extra security, and dispersed evenly and randomly across the globe, along with a map of where they are and how to reassemble them. Once again this is securely encrypted and only accessible to the holder of the keys.

The encrypted data chunks are held by a multitude of everyday devices, called nodes, these all offer a small portion of their spare, under-utilised capacity, to securely hold a small collection of encrypted data chunks, serving them back to their owner when asked.

Nodes in The Network are independent but work together in cooperation. Each has a randomly determined location in The Network, and from this location, monitors the health and behaviour of neighbouring nodes it connects to. Nodes check and double-check each other's ability to keep on holding and serving data.

They cooperate based on a set of rules and incentives that reward good behaviour but shun the bad; quickly dropping uncooperative nodes from The Network

Each piece of data stored is looked after by a small number of nodes called a close group, a group which only exists for that specific data. This allows nodes to act independently, but together to form a strong autonomous global network, capable of storing and retaining data in perpetuity.

As nodes come and go, as devices are turned on or off, this redundant data is replicated again and shuffled to new nodes that must perform the same task.

Nodes are rewarded for holding data, and offering their spare capacity for the collective good. In the early years payment will be made in Autonomi Network Token (an ERC20 standard token), but after the first stages of scale, adoption and growth a Native token will be introduced to The Network to act as a novel medium of exchange.

When someone (a person or a collective) uploads data they pay a fee to do so. The fee is a one-time charge; once paid (at point of upload) the data is stored for the lifetime of The Network. It will always be free for the owner to access and download, it is perpetual data.

While perpetual data is an attractive proposition in an age of spiralling ongoing costs, it is also essential if the data owner is to have true sovereignty, autonomy, and control over the data they own: you cannot be blocked from it and you cannot lose access to it.

That frees owners of data (whether they're individuals, collectives or organisations) from ongoing charges by cloud providers as well as aspects such as contract renegotiations, truth of source and terms of access (and use).

# Key Features

> **Autonomous** Autonomi goes a step beyond typical decentralized systems. It is a network that can act both as a global market for computer capacity, but also turn that capacity into usable capability that's native to the internet itself, not just a pointer to existing cloud services. It's a self-healing, course-correcting system; a huge resource layer that anyone can utilize with no permission required.

> **Infinite Scale** The Network is a form of Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) that doesn't utilize nor require a blockchain to function. It's able to sidestep many of the obstacles to scale inherent in blockchain solutions. The bigger it gets, the more it can do. The Network is designed to scale infinitely, at its initial, full public launch, and during its early stage of growth, Autonomi will use the widely supported EVM network, and an ERC20 standard token for payment (and incentive rewards) - before migrating to its Native Token.

> **Quantum-Secure Encryption** Anything stored on The Network is encrypted in a way that not even a quantum computer can break it. And it is end-to-end encrypted in transit too. This means you get all the benefits of the cloud, but without your data hitting the internet. That also means no one can watch or track your use of The Network either.

> **Commodity Devices** The Network is assembled from a multitude of connected devices, of all shapes and sizes. It's deliberately designed to allow even the smallest computers to be able to contribute, rather than just relying on enterprise data centres. Not only does this make the most of humanity's spare resources (better for the planet), but it means it's inherently more decentralized and secure (thanks to the millions of devices being able to participate).

> **Real-Time Payment System** Ahead of launching The Network's novel payment system and native currency, Autonomi will be utilising an ERC Token, referred to in this paper as ANT (Autonomi Network Token). Payments for data using $ANT happen instantly and are peer to peer - with node hosts providing a quote for data upload(s) and data owners accepting the same to pay a one-time fee for permanent secure storage of their data on The Network.

# Autonomi Protocol

## Overview

The Autonomi Protocol is built atop the lowest layers of the internet. Leveraging TCP/UDP it aims to provide a classical 'internet', but built upon decentralized peer-to-peer infrastructure. With the protocol in place, applications will be able to utilise the protocol URLs, allowing the safe and secure access of information stored on The Network—removing the need for any data to be stored on centralized servers.

Those using The Network will be able to fully control their data. Developers will be able to work with the protocol - easily reading and writing data on behalf of data owners (who remain in control), with simple APIs. This removes the need for complicated infrastructure, which reduces the cost burden for services, while allowing those building and providing data/content numerous paths to monetization, not possible on the incumbent web. The protocol also means that users and developers alike can manage and store their data, without ever needing to put their credentials on another machine. At a stroke, removing one of the principal targets for hackers.

## The Tech Stack

**Autonomi is comprised of both novel protocol innovations and battle hardened peer-to-peer networking technologies:**

### Self-Encryption

All content on Autonomi is encrypted. When a client uploads a piece of content to the Network it is first broken into chunks. These chunks are then [Self-Encrypted](https://autonomi.com/whitepapers/self-encrypting-data.md), where each chunk is encrypted using its own hash and the hash of the previous and following chunk. Self-Encryption is a process patented by 'MaidSafe', the company responsible for the conceptualization and delivery of the Network.

These encrypted chunks are then hashed again to derive an XOR Network address where the chunk will be stored. At the same time, a 'data map' is created on the client device, which maps the chunk number to the XOR network address of the chunk and the hash to decrypt it and its two successors, allowing the content to be recreated. A number of copies of each chunk are stored by nodes in the Network to ensure redundancy. This means quantum secure, content addressable data.

### Self-Authentication

With data self-encrypted, and its many parts stored by their content address throughout the Network, any one single point of file access is removed, as by default the map to this data is not publicly accessible on the Network. [Self-Authentication](https://autonomi.com/whitepapers/self-authentication.md) means access to this data, and the means to reassemble it into information, always resides with the user, never leaving their device (i.e. not accessible to a 'cloud').

Another key innovation of the Network—at no point does the Network ever store a user's credentials, there is no chance of passwords being attacked, nor can any user's data (individual, collective or organisation) be targeted on or via the Network. The authentication system utilises Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Distributed Key Generation (BLS), so that users can securely and anonymously access data, with no central server required to mediate the login process or trusted third parties to store and manage the users' credentials. It means users can reliably and securely access data from any machine, without ever sending or sharing their details.

Furthermore, it also allows for multi-signature credentials for permission-less recovery, without a single point of failure.

### Tokens and Payments

Autonomi will launch with an ERC standard network token (ANT) utilizing smart contracts for token releases and batching multiple transfers into single transactions for efficient gas usage. At the time of writing, a combination of 4MB chunk size and batching means a 150MB file is currently incurring $0.25 gas fee (noting while the quoted price here is currently indicative that it will be subject to Ethereum network fluctuations).

The decision to use a blockchain payment solution for the early launch phase of Autonomi (ahead of the network implementing its own Native Token) is, along with deployment time to market advantages, to assist in the network's ability to scale. Ethereum (Autonomi is using a 'roll-up chain' - Arbitrum One, an 'L2' - see 'Glossary of Terms' for brief description on both), is a battle-tested blockchain with proven and respected security features.

Until Autonomi has attracted significant levels of participants and data, accessing and benefiting from one of the biggest ecosystems of users, tools and applications (block explorers, DEXs, CEXs, wallet applications etc), will provide the network with significant advantages (via user access, assurance and experience) in its early phase of growth.

### Networking Libraries

The Autonomi Protocol is built atop of libp2p decentralized peer-to-peer network libraries. Specifically Rust and Kademlia. Kademlia is a well known, performant peer-to-peer discovery mechanism. Libp2p is a battle tested networking library, in wide use in such projects as IPFS, Filecoin and Ethereum. Libp2p's Rust implementation is a reliable, performant networking stack on which the Autonomi transactional and data layers are constructed, making the whole network tick.

The Autonomi Protocol builds on Kademlia to securely store the data on nodes, automate replication and securely and verifiably provide a native token for exchange. The Kademlia network also provides a simple and well-tested content addressable system, which allows for the building of data discovery and transaction verification mechanisms.

The Rust libraries are used for reference implementation, the protocol is principally built in Rust, due to it being a high performance language, offering strong memory safety and security guarantees.

### Storing Data and Scaling Storage

Every piece of data that comprises a file must be paid for before a node will initially store that data. Once paid for and validated, that node will replicate the data throughout its close group. This prevents spam, and ensures nodes are rewarded for their contributions. In the early stages of The Network, nodes will quote in, and be paid using, Autonomi Network Token (ANT), this quote will be normalized by The Network token price and by other nodes in The Network quoting to host data. The relationship between upload price and live token value will be made via a blockchain contract that will verifiably provide the price of ANT.

The Network is designed to scale. More nodes, mean that more groups can validate more transactions and store more data. As data is uploaded, The Network utilization increases, leading to higher value data upload payments, encouraging more nodes to come online. If more nodes come online, the data density is reduced and the price lowers as capacity increases.

As The Network is dependent on data upload, along with one time data payments, there will be 'network emissions', in the early years, these will support the incentive for running nodes (while amount of data for nodes to host are increasing). These emissions will also support data uploaders, by providing competitive pricing (with emissions subsidising some of the data upload costs being levied by nodes, while more nodes are encouraged to come online).

The decision to utilize emissions to support early rewards and upload pricing for network users, rather than using Autonomi Foundation funds to pay for data uploads to The Network, was taken to ensure that The Autonomi Foundation is not using network capacity by uploading data to supplement node rewards, as this could potentially just drive costs up further for participants wishing to upload to The Network.

### Scaling Data Retrieval

With more nodes, the data density is lower. So every node will be fielding _fewer_ requests for data. With opportunistic caching of popular data, The Network will see requests to this same data being fielded faster and faster - as there are more nodes in more places on The Network storing that data (similar to how BitTorrent download speeds increase with more seeders).

### Running Nodes

Nodes are designed to be small and performant. The network operates via nodes that are hosted on everyday/commodity devices, multiple nodes can be run on machines (personal, home or office), with even a Raspberry Pi able to host. A normal laptop should easily be able to run one in the background, and it should not require much space (nodes consume a maximum of 64GB, although, unless The Network is full, a node will consume significantly less space). As the hardware requirements for nodes are low, high-powered, centralized storage is not required, meaning The Network can scale infinitely while staying truly decentralized.

The rationale for ensuring a "small node" focus can be attributed to [there reportedly being 2 billion personal computers](https://gitnux.org/personal-computer-statistics/) in the world - if 10% of those chose to run nodes, that would be 200 million nodes. This is where a content addressed network can really begin to shine. It doesn't require any one node to know _all_ nodes in the network, nor anything remotely close to it, meaning it can still scale to vast numbers as required. We believe focusing on small nodes will lead us to scale much better than our competitors. People around the world can run nodes with their everyday devices, without needing to make dedicated capital investment.

Elaborating further, infrastructure-based projects often use pricing systems grounded in 'Return on Investment' (ROI) calculations. For instance, when a cloud infrastructure provider builds a data centre, the pricing for services such as storage, egress, and ingress is typically determined based on metrics like initial investment, ongoing maintenance costs, and asset depreciation. The same principle applies to decentralized storage solutions that require participants to make capital investments. Individuals and businesses running these systems calculate ROI in much the same way as cloud service providers.

With Autonomi, node operators are not required to make dedicated capital investments. This approach not only enables the Autonomi Network to offer services at a significantly lower cost but also achieve true decentralization.

> Reduction in raw resource cost can be achieved not only by technological advances, but also by allowing existing devices to participate in the network.

### Building on the Protocol

The Autonomi Network is a decentralized platform that uses the spare capacity of everyday devices to run nodes that work, without intervention to form a highly distributed, secure and flexible storage layer. The protocol lends itself to easy creation, management, and reading of app data and other content. Applications can be built on top of standardized, mutable data types, allowing for rich products and experiences to be developed.

Every company is a data company, yet few have access to the high quality data, licenses or tools they need to close the gap between their disruptive ideas and the information giants of the internet. It's thought that personal AI (worth $13 billion in 2024) will hit $50 billion by 2030. Permissioned access to personal, high quality data will be valuable to any company trying to innovate, and to the data owners who are happy to participate.

With Autonomi, an application, no matter its nature, never has to ask for user's information, and never has to consider ongoing storage costs. So while users can access the functionality they know and new experiences they like, they can do so, without ever having to compromise their ownership or rights over their personal data.

Our shared ability to take back control of the internet is largely dependent on our ability to innovate and influence. The quality of experience given to us, and the information available to us, that is also knowingly and willing (with clear benefits) shared by us, is critical to this - the Autonomi Network makes this and more possible.

# Tokenomics

**Permanent Storage With One-off Payment**

Most cloud storage services charge based on **GB per time**—the price depends on both the size of the data and the duration of storage. While this pricing model is straightforward, it requires users to actively manage their billing accounts. If the account is not maintained, the data can be lost, often leaving users to realize too late that they never truly owned their data.

However, a careful analysis of the cost dynamics in cloud storage reveals the potential for a **one-time pricing model**. Such a model could sustain the platform while granting users full, lasting ownership of their data.

### Raw Resource Cost

A cloud storage system operates on raw resources, regardless of whether it is decentralised. The primary components include hard disks and bandwidth for data ingress, as well as egress and inter-node communications.

The cost of raw resources has been declining exponentially over the past decades, and this trend is expected to continue. For example, if a user uploads a 1 GB file, the cost of storing this data will decrease exponentially over time.

$$ RP(t)=RP_0 \times e^{-\lambda t} $$

Where

- $RP(t) = \text{Unit resource price at time t}$
- $RP_0 = \text{Initial unit resource price}$
- $\lambda = \text{Decay rate}$

### Data Volume

Humanity's data generation and storage rates have been increasing exponentially. We watch 4K HD videos and use data-intensive applications every day. Global IP traffic has (at the time of writing) reached 4.8 zettabytes (ZB) per year - a zettabyte is one sextillion bytes. By way of context, if you watched this data in a video format, at a standard 1 GB per hour of HD video, it would take you over 114,000 years to watch a zettabyte of content. Our conclusion is that modern data storage systems should anticipate exponential growth in data generation volume.

**Exponential growth model for data upload rate**

$$ U(t) = U_0 \times e^{kt} $$

**Cumulative Uploaded Data Amount**

$$ C(t) = \int_{0}^{t} U(\tau) , d\tau = \int_{0}^{t} U_0 \cdot e^{k\tau} , d\tau $$

$$ C(t) = \frac{U_0}{k} \left( e^{kt} - 1 \right) $$

where

- $U(t) = \text{Upload rate at time t}$
- $U_0 = \text{Initial upload rate}$
- $k = \text{Growth rate}$
- $C(t) = \text{Cumulative uploaded data amount at time t}$

### Putting Cost & Volume Together

If we aim to build a storage system sustained by a one-time payment mechanism for permanent storage, we can outline the economic model as follows:

> The total payment amount at time t must be equal to or exceed the total cost of maintaining the raw resources for all cumulatively uploaded data.

$$ P(t) \times U(t) >= C(t) \times RP(t) $$

where

- $P(t) = \text{Unit upload price at time t}$

The minimum viable value of $P(t)$ can be expressed as below:

$$ P(t) = \frac{RP_0}{k} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right) e^{-\lambda t} $$

At time $t=0$, both $e^{-\lambda t}$ and $e^{-(k + \lambda)t}$ terms equal 1. However, the second term decays more rapidly, resulting in an initial increase in price. As $t$ increases, the first term becomes dominant, causing the price to decline exponentially.

As long as the two exponential assumptions—the data upload rate and the raw resource price decline rate—hold, a storage system can be sustained by a one-time payment for permanent storage. Additionally, the size of the payment can decline exponentially.

## How Upload Price is Determined

### Flexibility Through Proxy Metrics

The Network itself does not directly track the actual price of resources. However, the availability of resources provided by the nodes can serve as an effective proxy. As individuals gain access to increasingly powerful and spacious everyday devices, The Network naturally benefits from greater access to raw resources. For instance, it is now common for mobile phones to offer hundreds of gigabytes of storage and substantial processing power. With such devices, you could potentially run multiple network nodes using just on your phone. If this trend continues, it is conceivable that mobile phones in the near future could come equipped with terabytes of storage. This ongoing reduction in raw resource costs would manifest as an increased supply rate within The Network.

Accurately predicting future reductions in raw resource costs is inherently difficult and arguably not a particularly meaningful exercise. For this reason, the Autonomi pricing system avoids reliance on concrete projections. Instead, it is designed to adapt based on the current availability of resources relative to the infrastructure needed to maintain existing data. This flexible system ensures functionality (sustaining The Network through short-term volatilises), as long as these two key exponential assumptions remain valid. Those being that:

- Data upload rate will increase exponentially
- Raw resource cost will decrease exponentially

### Quote Calculations

The pricing within The Network is determined by a supply-and-demand mechanism. Each node assesses its internal resource availability to calculate the price it needs to charge. Specifically, a node compares the number of records it is responsible for storing against the maximum capacity of records a node is allowed to hold.

Because The Network uniformly distributes the addresses of both nodes and records, the number of records assigned to each node accurately reflects the ratio between the total number of nodes (indicating storage space supply) and the total number of records (indicating storage space demand). The ANT token will serve as The Network's currency during the early phases of network scale (in future this will be valued at 1:1 with 'Native Token' when the same becomes available). As a result, the effective payment amount in 'FIAT' terms depends on ANT's market value, which will be inherently volatile. To address this, prices are normalized by the token price, ensuring that The Network's size and functionality are governed by the true supply and demand for storage space, rather than fluctuations in market conditions.

> 💡 The number of nodes in The Network is constrained by the availability of raw resources such as disk space, bandwidth, and CPU power. Consequently, the node count alone should not be used to infer the total network capacity, as this would incorrectly assume that disk space is the sole limiting factor.

$$ p = \frac{1}{\text{ANT Price}} \times ( \frac{-s}{r - 1} - 1) + p_{min} $$

Where 'P' is current price and:

- $r = \frac{record_{current}}{record_{max}}$ _(measure of 'fullness')_
- $s=\text{scaling factor}$
- $p_{min} = \text{minimum price}$

### Emission Incentives

As it can be seen from the charts above, the fair storage price will initially rise. The system must overcome this initial price resistance to benefit from the subsequent decline in price, driven by increasing data upload rates and decreasing raw resource costs. To address this **initial friction**, The Network will provide additional incentives to node operators during The Network's early stages - derived from an emission allocation.

To do this The Autonomi Foundation will mint new ANT tokens and distribute them to the participating node operators.

**How long does the emission need to last**

We can solve for the time when the average upload price starts to fall by finding the maximum of the price function, the expectation is that emissions will only be required in the early years of the network (to ensure and encourage its growth).

$$ \frac{d,\text{P}(t)}{dt} = 0 $$

Recall:

$$ \text{P}(t) = \frac{P_0}{k} \left( 1 - e^{-kt} \right) e^{-\lambda t} $$

Let:

$$ A = \frac{P_0}{k} $$

$$ \frac{d,\text{P}(t)}{dt} = A \left[ \frac{d}{dt} \left(1 - e^{-kt}\right) \cdot e^{-\lambda t} + \left(1 - e^{-kt}\right) \cdot \frac{d}{dt} \left(e^{-\lambda t}\right) \right] $$

Calculate derivatives:

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \left(1 - e^{-kt}\right) = k e^{-kt} $$

$$ \frac{d}{dt} \left(e^{-\lambda t}\right) = -\lambda e^{-\lambda t} $$

Substitute:

$$ \frac{d,\text{P}(t)}{dt} = A \left[ k e^{-kt} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} - \lambda \left(1 - e^{-kt}\right) e^{-\lambda t} \right] $$

$$ \frac{d,\text{P}(t)}{dt} = A e^{-\lambda t} \left( (k + \lambda) e^{-kt} - \lambda \right) $$

Now solve for $\frac{d,\text{P}(t)}{dt} = 0$.

$$ A e^{-\lambda t} \left( (k + \lambda) e^{-kt} - \lambda \right) = 0 $$

Since $A$ and $e^{-\lambda t}$ are both non-zero, we can solve for

$$ (k + \lambda) e^{-kt} - \lambda = 0 $$

$$ e^{-kt} = \frac{\lambda}{k + \lambda} $$

$$ -kt = \ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{k + \lambda}\right) $$

$$ t = -\frac{1}{k} \ln\left(\frac{\lambda}{k + \lambda}\right) $$

$$ t_{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{k} \ln\left(1 + \frac{k}{\lambda}\right) $$

Using the expression above, one can calculate how long it will take to reach the peak upload price at different yearly cost reduction rates and yearly upload increase rates.

## Emissions to Support Network Growth

Based on the peak calculation above, under most scenarios, it is reasonable to increase the rate of emissions until year 7 and slowly reduce the emission rate thereafter. The chart below shows the projected emission rate.

## Network Node Reserve

While the rates of data upload and raw resource price decline can appear perfectly smooth in the charts, the reality can be quite different. Changes can be influenced by the introduction of new hardware technologies, applications that utilize The Network, and more. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect, or at least be prepared for, temporary (local) mismatches.

The 'Network Node Reserve' is designed to safeguard The Network against such circumstances. The reserve will be funded by a portion of the data upload payments and will only ever be used (via smart contract) to incentivize node operators if and when the data upload rate falls below the average upload rate - causing a risk of capacity volatility or disruption on the network. Should such an event occur then the 'Network Node Reserve' will release tokens in order to provide ongoing incentives for network nodes to stay online.

Note: if the Network Node Reserve amount hits 10% of the Max Supply of network tokens, then any further payments to the Node Network Reserve will be set at 2% of data upload payments and will be immediately burned (leading to a decrease in maximum token supply).

### Key Properties of the Token Network

The token for Autonomi serves as the incentive for node operators to join The Network and cooperate toward the goal of providing secure data storage. Conceptually this is similar to that of Bitcoin: _to ensure that cooperative participation is a more rational course of action than uncooperative or malicious activity_.

Tokens can also be transferred directly between users and used as a means to pay third parties for goods and services. There is no charge for downloading data, but uploaders must pay a one-time fee to pay for storage.

Below are some of the key properties of the Autonomi token:

> **Maximum Supply**
> 
> There will be a total Maximum Supply of 1,200,000,000 (1.2 Billion) tokens created over The Network's lifetime. This has been reduced from a Maximum Supply of 4,294,967,296 (4.29 Billion) tokens. The reason for this decrease is derived from two factors:
> 
> 1. A more limited emissions schedule, with the same now only applying to support the early phase of The Network
> 2. Decrease in number of tokens held by The Autonomi Foundation (emitted over time via Smart Contract release)

- Every data upload incurs payments from uploaders to node operators (including during the early phase of The Network an applicable 'gas fee' - please see batching comments under 'Tokens and Payments').
- Unlike conventional cloud or decentralized storage, there is no extra or ongoing fee beyond the initial data payment, preventing cost escalation. This transparent payment system ensures predictability and affordability for users, and allows applications and services to scale rapidly without large data or infrastructure cost burdens.
- Most importantly, this approach allows the system to not track data ownership and not give anyone the ability to delete files. This is vitally important for the security and privacy aspect of The Autonomi Network.
- Physical infrastructure-based decentralized platforms require upfront infrastructure availability before usage can scale. This not only applies to the DePIN projects, but also to cloud providers such as AWS and GCP. To support node network growth, there will be early emission incentives for node operators (please see 'Emissions Incentives')
- Node operators will be incentivized to provide correct service to The Network (qualifying to quote for data uploads by being available and online) - incorrect service will result in exclusion from the ability to quote and receive payments for hosting. Ultimately, incorrect behaviours will result in prompt exclusion of the nodes from The Network, removing their ability to earn.
- Tokens (in the early phases of the network) will be on the Ethereum Network (as an ERC20 standard token) and will, by extension, benefit from the transferability, accessibility and integrations boasted by the same.

# Data Payments

Tokens are automatically distributed by The Network to the operators of nodes as payment for the supply of data storage, bandwidth, and compute resources: these are 'Resource Supply Rewards'. Before a file is stored on The Network, it is broken into chunks and encrypted. Each chunk has a unique hash value from which its network address is derived.

Nodes also have a unique network address. Data is stored on the nodes which have the closest network address to the data itself.

A client can find the nodes that are closest to a chunk's address by querying The Network. Once it knows the closest nodes, it performs a 'store cost' query to ask the price to store data at that location. The price depends on the storage capacity of the nodes, which ultimately depends on demand.

Once the client knows the store costs offered by the closest nodes, it picks one and sends the data along with the transfer paying for it. Upon receiving the data, the chosen node verifies the transfer, takes the payment, verifies the data itself and stores it. It is then replicated to the other close nodes. To receive payment a node needs to store new data and already have all the existing data in its range. The payment only includes the hash of the quote provided by the node. So third party cannot extract the connection between the payer and the data.

Data payments serve as a fundamental incentive mechanism through which data uploaders directly compensate node operators for network utility. When a file is uploaded to The Network, it will be broken down into multiple small chunks, with each chunk assigned its own network address based on its content. These chunks will then be stored in a group of nodes whose network addresses are close to the respective chunk. Since the chunk hash is randomly distributed over the address space, data payment will be random and evenly distributed at scale.

As The Network scales, the likelihood of a node receiving data payment increases linearly with its uptime. Nodes that don't contribute to the protocol will be ignored by neighbouring nodes, thereby excluding them from the reward mechanism. These mechanisms resemble Proof-of-Uptime and Proof-of-Correctness models employed by other decentralized protocols to encourage desirable participant behavior.

82% of the data payments are allocated to node operators, while the remainder is automatically sent to the 'Node Network Reserve' (see: 'Network Node Reserve').

# Token Allocation

### Token Holders

MaidSafeCoin (also known and referred to as 'OMNI MAID') was the origin token of the MaidSafe project, at the time known as The SAFE Network. It was issued as part of a crowd-sale in April of 2014 (MaidSafeCoin was the 10th crypto token ever to launch). These tokens have a 1:1 relationship to ANT (and Autonomi's future 'Native Token'). Token holders also include those with 'EMAID' (the current ERC-20 token), these holders will be 'airdropped' ANT 1:1 at or shortly following The Network's Token Generation Event (TGE), following an advised 'wallet' snapshot. Also included in this the group of 'Token Holders' are those who have earned token allocations via network testing incentives and reward programs prior to TGE - these participants, will receive ANT at a ratio of 1:1 to 'Test Tokens'.

This allocation represents 38% of the Maximum Supply, an increase of 8% from 1.0 of the White Paper.

### Emissions Allocation

In the early years of The Network especially there is need and therefore an allocation for emissions - governed by a smart contract. Based on community feedback this pool has been reduced to 240,000,000 tokens (20% of Max Supply), which will be emitted over a 12 year period. This is a change from 3,167,866,884 tokens, representing 70% of the Maximum Supply, which was to be emitted (at a diminishing rate) over a period of 30 years. Please see 'Storing Data and Scaling Storage' to read more why it's felt that emissions are a critical part of supporting growth in the early years.

### Autonomi Foundation

The Autonomi Foundation (formerly known as the SAFE Foundation), will play a critical role in enhancing the network through 3 specific areas of activity:

1. **Network Support:** via marketing and partnerships (including but not limited to centralized exchange requirements and liquidity provisions)
2. **Network Support:** via network team responsible for improvements and key developments - Native Token, Mobile Nodes and Upgrades
3. **Network Incentive:** via reward and incentive payments to network applications, builders and supporters

The Autonomi Foundation will receive payments via a Smart Contract with allocated amounts that will unlock over a 50 year period:

- 20% Year 1
- 34% Years 2 - 5
- 31% Years 6 - 12
- 15% Years 13 - 50

### MaidSafe Shareholders

Shareholders have been allocated 214,748,365 tokens which will be distributed after the TGE.

# The Difference with Autonomi

While there are a multitude of decentralized networks and protocols in use, many can only be considered partially autonomous; have limitations to large-scale use; require compromises on security or data persistence; or have large barriers to entry and cost burdens.

Autonomi is designed from the ground up to address these issues and provide all the necessary ingredients required to meet the ambitions and promise of a truly decentralised and autonomous network.

* When Autonomi's Native Token is in use

** For Private Data on Arweave: While private or encrypted data can technically be stored, the platform's design makes it best suited for public data due to its permanence.

*** Arweave can support encryption, but it is not native to its design.

^ Holochain takes an agent-centric approach to autonomy, rather than a data and network first approach.

^^ Participants in Holochain must participate in both supply and demand of data; where clients hold a fork of application data.

# Glossary of Terms

### ANT

Short for: 'Autonomi Network Token', an ERC20 standard token that will be distributed (see 'Token Allocation'), as well as spent and earned by using and/or supporting the Autonomi Network. A '$' sign maybe used in front of it to indicate that it is a cryptocurrency.

### Autonomi

An autonomous data network built on the Autonomi Protocol that supports a rich application ecosystem to be created by developers and enjoyed by participants.

### Autonomi Foundation

Formerly known as the SAFE Foundation, the Autonomi Foundation is a Not-For-Profit organisation based in Switzerland, it is responsible for the 'ANT' token generation event (TGE) and will also mint Network Emissions. The Foundation will also have access to Network Tokens (50 year schedule) that will be allocated/spend to support Autonomi - especially in the early years.

### Autonomi Protocol

A collection of open source algorithms, libraries and components that allows computers to form an autonomous data network.

### Arbitrum One

A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enhancing speed and reducing costs for transactions while maintaining Ethereum's security.

### Boneh-Lynn-Shacham Distributed Key Generation (BLS-DKG)

A cryptographic system that authenticates the sender of a message, allows for multiple parties to quickly come to a consensus, and can enable multi-signature transactions and n-of-k credentials.

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance

The ability of a decentralised network to function properly even if up to a third of the nodes (plus 1) is corrupt or faulty.

### CashNote

For the Native Token - an encrypted digital 'cheque' for a given value containing all the necessary information for the owner of the associate secret key to spend that value.

### Churn

Nodes joining and leaving a Network.

### Chunk

An immutable data type.

### Client

Software that allows users to connect to the Network and make use of its services.

### Conflict-free Data Types (CRDTs)

Data structures that obey certain mathematical rules which ensure that when multiple versions of data exist across a distributed network, eventually these will always converge onto one 'true' version.

### Data Map

A record of content chunks and their corresponding locations on the Network. Only users in possession of the Data Map can recreate the file.

### Data Payment

A one-time payment made upfront for data storage.

### Distributed Hash Table

A map of where data is stored on a distributed network.

### FIAT

FIAT currency is money declared by a government to be legal tender, not backed by a physical commodity. "Fiat" comes from Latin, meaning "let it be done," indicating it's value by decree.

### GossipSub

A libp2p publish/subscribe system whereby peers congregate around topics they are interested in by subscribing to them.

### Kademlia

A distributed hash table (DHT) protocol which provides a way for millions of computers to self-organize into a network.

### L2 / Layer 2

A scaling solutions built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to increase transaction speed and reduce costs.

### Libp2p

A Kademlia-based open source peer-to-peer networking framework.

### MaidSafe.Net / MaidSafe

A Limited Company registered in Scotland (SC297540), that has designed, developed and deployed the Autonomi Network (formerly known as SAFE Network). Following 'TGE', all shareholders of MaidSafe will have the opportunity to 'exit' through ANT token being sent by the Autonomi Foundation in exchange for shares (note: a 'wallet' will be required to take custody of tokens). Following this, MaidSafe will be owned by the Not-For-Profit Autonomi Foundation (formerly known as the SAFE Foundation), that is based in Switzerland.

### MaidSafeCoin

A cryptocurrency token currently available for purchase that will be exchangeable 1:1 for Autonomi Network and/or Native Token(s) (MAID and EMAID)

### Node

A machine that connects with others using the Autonomi Protocol to form the Network.

### Node Network Reserve

18% of data payments (up to 10% of maximum supply) are sent to this allocation for node operators. This allocation will be used to support payments to nodes should the network upload values experience volatility. If the Node Network Reserve holds 10% of the network's Maximum Supply of tokens, 18% payment reduces to 2%, with the 2% payment burned (removed from Maximum Supply).

### Register

### Spend

For the Native Token - Transaction information is stored on the Network.

### Storage Reward Rate

An adjustable factor that determines the rate of pay of participating Nodes; it is increased when more storage is needed, decreased when there is an excess of storage space.

### TGE / Token Generation Event

The process of issuing and distributing a new cryptocurrency or token.

### Tokens

The Autonomi Network Token ('ANT'), and then the 'Native' Token of Autonomi, are earned by storing data and spent by uploading data. For purposes of this white paper and ahead of the launch of Autonomi, may simply be referred to as 'tokens'.

### Token Emission

240,000,000 tokens, representing 20% of the Maximum Supply, will be emitted at a diminishing rate over a period of 12 years.

### Transfer

A monetary transaction on the Network.

### Wallet
